# CS-305-Software-Security

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that creates financial plans that are specific to their clients. With the importance of software security growing larger in today’s current cyber climate, Artemis Financial is looking to bolster its software security and modernize its operation systems to the most effective security that is current and up-to-date. The client’s web application interface currently uses the REST API, which is a step in the correct direction but seeks expertise to examine their systems and find vulnerabilities as well as give suggestions about how to further improve the security of their systems to better protect against external threats.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did well when finding vulnerabilities in my client's software using the industry's best standards when coding. For instance, the REST API was used in the SslServerApplication.java file to handle requests made to the /hash endpoint using a REST Controller. REST is also a common API used in web services. Using a RESTful API improves the security, scalability, and performance of any application that implements it. Additionally, a checksum was used to verify the integrity of the data string output by the bytesToHex function. The purpose of this is to detect if the data has been tampered with when the data is in transit or stored. The checksum used the SHA-256 cipher algorithm to create a secure hash from the string. This hash prevents the data from being modified by an unauthorized user and prevents the application’s security from being compromised. Lastly, the HTTPS protocol was used to ensure that connections to the application are secure and encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This ensures that the data transferred between clients and the application is authentic and confidential, and attacks like man-in-the-middle are prevented. The use of certificates verified by a CA will further bolster the security of the data transfer to and from the application. HTTPS ensures that all connections to and from the application are encrypted and secure.
The measures implemented ensure Artemis Financial’s overall well-being by securing their software in all aspects which in turn increases the quality of their software and satisfies their customer's needs. Using a common API and best practices can make it easier for the company to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and avoid run-ins with international laws and regulations. It can also reduce the possibility of receiving a security breach which can cause high costs in maintenance, dealing a blow to company revenue and even the company’s reputation. Following these best practices can ensure that a company is successful, innovative, and responsible, earning the trust and loyalty of its customers.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Identifying false positives in the Maven dependency report and suppressing them in the supression.xml proved to help identify the vulnerabilities that mattered. However, removing all of the vulnerabilities before refactoring the code was challenging, and I could not suppress all of the vulnerabilities from the report. Therefore, I used the remaining number of vulnerabilities as a benchmark against the dependency check made after refactoring the code. 

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
